  <h1>History of fractals</h1>
  Letâ€™s begin our discussion of recursion by examining 
  the first appearance of fractals in modern mathematics. 
  In 1883, German mathematician George Cantor developed 
  simple rules to generate an infinite set:
    1: Start with a line
    2: Erase the middle third of that line
    3: Recursively call step 2
  <form action="/cantor">
    <input type="submit" value="Generate cantor!" />
  </form>

  This fractal draws an ellipse based on a set of parameters 
  that it receives as arguments. It then calls itself with 
  those same parameters, adjusting them slightly. The result 
  is a series of circles, each of which is drawn inside the previous circle.
  <form action="/circle1">
    <input type="submit" value="Generate first circle fractal!" />
  </form>

  For every circle displayed, draw a circle half its size to the 
  left and right of that circle.
  <form action="/circle2">
    <input type="submit" value="Generate second circle fractal!" />
  </form>

  Adding a circle above, below, left and right of the first one.
  <form action="/circle3">
    <input type="submit" value="Generate third circle fractal!" />
  </form>
  Now, to mandelbrot fractal!
  <form action="/mandelbrot&#63;iteration=1000&amp;complexReal=0&amp;complexIm=0&amp;scale=2&amp;zReal=-0.4&amp;zComplex=0.6">
    <input type="submit" value="Generate mandelbrot fractal!" />
  </form>
}
